*** WARNING ***

This is a development version of Zebedee.  Not all features
have been thoroughly tested and may not work correctly. They
could damage your system or leave it open to security
compromise. Use at your own risk!

Please note that the checksumming protocol in this version
is *incompatible* with that in version 2.5.1. This has been
caused by a fix for cross-platform interoperability. As a
temporary measure, you can set the "bugcompatibility"
keyword to "251" to revert to the previous version. This
will not (and has never) worked between systems with
different byte ordering. The "bugcompatibility" keyword will
be removed from the next version.
